# SQL_practice_and_application

This repository contains two different notebooks with the objective of practicing some basics skills in SQL:

* SQL with Pandas: in this notebook I'll show how to realize SQL queries using the sqlite3 library. Going from csv files, to creating a SQL Database, save the dataframes as SQL tables and finally query them.

* Postgres SQL: Postgres is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance. It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to data warehouses or Web services. In this notebook I'll be exploring how to connect to a a database using psycopg2, which's the most popular PostgreSQL adapter for Python.
